# Fake News Detection

### Introduction

Fake news detection is important in the modern digital world. There are several approaches to detect misinformation. 

This model focuses on detecting fake news by differentiating the writing style. The advantage is that, without knowing the source & its credibility, still be able to detect fake news. It introduces an approach that is based on the belief that the best performing model needs to be customized to the data features. 

This pipeline assigns significant focus on exploratory data analysis, multiple testing, and finding the optimal tokenization and normalization methods. For instance, the model performance was enhanced by switching from lemmatization to stemming. 

The model is subitted to the fake news detection contest at the Second International True Fact Workshop, KDD2020. Ranked the 6th in the [Kaggle in-class competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fakenewskdd2020/leaderboard).
